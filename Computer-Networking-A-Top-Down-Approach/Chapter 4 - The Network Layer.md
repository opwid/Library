# Introduction
## Forwarding and Routing
The role of the network layer is thus deceptively simple -to move packets from a sending host to a receiving host. To do so, two important network-layer functions can be identified:

* _Forwarding_: When a packet arrives at a router's input link, the router must move the packet to the appropriate output link.
* _Routing_: The network layer must determine the route or path taken by packets as they flow from a sender to a receiver. The algorithms that calculate these paths are referred to as routing algorithms.

The terms forwarding and routing are often used interchangeably by authors discussing the network layer. Forwarding refers to the router-local action of transferring a packet from an input link interface to the appropriate output link interface. Routing refers to the network-wide process that determines the end-to-end paths that packets take from source to destination.  

Every router has a __forwarding table__. A router forwards a packet by examining the value of a field in the arriving packet's header, and then using this header value to index into the router's forwarding table. The value stored in the forwarding table entry for that header indicates the router's outgoing link interface to which that packet is to be forwarded. Depending on the network-layer protocol, the header value could be the destination address of the packet or an indication of the connection to which the packet belongs.  

You might now be wondering how the forwarding tables in the routers are configured. This is a crucial issue, one that exposes the important interplay between routing and forwarding. The routing algorithm determines the values that are inserted into the router's forwarding tables. The routing algorithm may be centralized (e.g., with an algorithm executing on a central site and downloading routing information to each of the routers) or decentralized (i.e., with a piece of the distributed routing algorithm running in each router). In either case, a router receives routing protocol messages, which are used to configure its forwarding table. We're thus fortunate that all networks have both a forwarding and a routing function!  

We'll reserve the term packet switch to mean a general packet-switching device that transfers a packet from input link interface to output link interface, according to the value in a field in the header of the packet. Some packet switches, called link-layer switches, base their forwarding decision on values in the fields of the link-layer frame; switches are thus referred to as link-layer (layer 2) devices. Other packet switches, called routers, base their forwarding decision on the value in the network-layer field. Routers are thus network-layer (layer 3) devices, but must also implement layer 2 protocols as well, since layer 3 devices require the services of layer 2 to implement their (layer 3) functionality. To confuse matters, marketing literature often refers to "layer 3 switches" for routers with Ethernet interfaces, but these are really layer 3 devices. Since our focus in this chapter is on the network layer, we use the term router in place of packet switch. We'll even use the term router when talking about packet switches in virtual-circuit networks.

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connection Setup</h3>
We just said that the network layer has two important functions, forwarding and routing. But we'll soon see that in some computer networks there is actually a third important network-layer function, namely, connection setup. Recall from our study of TCP that a three-way handshake is required before data can flow from sender to receiver. This allows the sender and receiver to set up the needed state information (for example, sequence number and initial flow-control window size). In an analogous manner, some network-layer architectures -for example, ATM, frame relay, and MPL- require the routers along the chosen path from source to destination to handshake with each other in order to set up state before network-layer data packets within a given source-to-destination connection can begin to flow. In the network layer, this process is referred to as connection setup.

## Network Service Model
The network service model defines the characteristics of end-to-end transport of packets between sending and receiving end systems. The Internet's network layer provides a single service, known as best-effort service. From Table 4.1, it might appear that best-effort service is a euphemism for no service at all.  

![4_1](https://github.com/opwid/Library/blob/master/Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach/Images/4_1.png) 

Other network architectures have defined and implemented service models that go beyond the Internet's best-effort service. For example, the ATM network architecture provides for multiple service models, meaning that different connections can be provided with different classes of service within the same network.

# Virtual Circuit and Datagram Networks
A network layer can provide connectionless service or connection service between two hosts. Network-layer connection and connectionless services in many ways parallel transport-layer connection-oriented and connectionless services. For example, a network-layer connection service begins with handshaking between the source and destination hosts; and a network-layer connectionless service does not have any handshaking preliminaries.  

Although the network-layer connection and connectionless services have some parallels with transport-layer connection-oriented and connectionless services, there are crucial differences:

* In the network layer, these services are host-to-host services provided by the network layer for the transport layer. In the transport layer these services are process-to-process services provided by the transport layer for the application layer.
* In all major computer network architectures to date (Internet, ATM, frame relay, and so on), the network layer provides either a host-to-host connectionless service or a host-to-host connection service, but not both. Computer networks that provide only a connection service at the network layer are called __virtual-circuit (VC) networks__; computer networks that provide only a connectionless service at the network layer are called __datagram networks__.
* The implementations of connection-oriented service in the transport layer and the connection service in the network layer are fundamentally different. We'll see shortly that the network-layer connection service is implemented in the routers in the network core as well as in the end systems. 
## Virtual Circuits
While the Internet is a datagram network, many alternative network architectures -including those of ATM and frame relay- are virtual-circuit networks and, therefore, use connections at the network layer. These network-layer connections are called virtual circuits (VCs). Let's now consider how a VC service can be implemented in a computer network.  
A VC consists of (1) a path (that is, a series of links and routers) between the source and destination hosts, (2) VC numbers, one number for each link along the path, and (3) entries in the forwarding table in each router along the path. A packet belonging to a virtual circuit will carry a VC number in its header. Because a virtual circuit may have a different VC number on each link, each intervening router must replace the VC number of each traversing packet with a new VC number. The new VC number is obtained from the forwarding table.  
To illustrate the concept, consider the network shown in Figure 4.3. The numbers next to the links of R1 in Figure 4.3 are the link interface numbers. Suppose now that Host A requests that the network establish a VC between itself and Host B. Suppose also that the network chooses the path A-R1-R2-B and assigns VC numbers 12, 22, and 32 to the three links in this path for this virtual circuit. In this case, when a packet in this VC leaves Host A, the value in the VC number field in the packet header is 12; when it leaves R1, the value is 22; and when it leaves R2, the value is 32.  
![4_3](https://github.com/opwid/Library/blob/master/Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach/Images/4_3.png)  

How does the router determine the replacement VC number for a packet traversing the router? For a VC network, each router's forwarding table includes VC number translation; for example, the forwarding table in R1 might look something like this:  
![4_3_1](https://github.com/opwid/Library/blob/master/Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach/Images/4_3_1.png)  

Whenever a new VC is established across a router, an entry is added to the forwarding table. Similarly, whenever a VC terminates, the appropriate entries in each table along its path are removed.  
You might be wondering why a packet doesn't just keep the same VC number on each of the links along its route. The answer is twofold. First, replacing the number from link to link reduces the length of the VC field in the packet header. Second, and more importantly, VC setup is considerably simplified by permitting a different VC number at each link along the path of the VC.  
In a VC network, the network's routers must maintain __connection state information__ for the ongoing connections. Specifically, each time a new connection is established across a router, a new connection entry must be added to the router's forwarding table; and each time a connection is released, an entry must be removed from the table. Note that even if there is no VC-number translation, it is still necessary to maintain connection state information that associates VC numbers with output interface numbers.  
There are three identifiable phases in a virtual circuit:

* VC Setup: During the setup phase, the sending transport layer contacts the network layer, specifies the receiver's address, and waits for the network to set up the VC. The network layer determines the path between sender and receiver, that is, the series of links and routers through which all packets of the VC will travel. The network layer also determines the VC number for each link along the path. Finally, the network layer adds an entry in the forwarding table in each router along the path. During VC setup, the network layer may also reserve resources (for example, bandwidth) along the path of the VC.
* Data Transfer: Once the VC has been established, packets can begin to flow along the VC.
* VC Teardown: This is initiated when the sender (or receiver) informs the network layer of its desire to terminate the VC. The network layer will then typically inform the end system on the other side of the network of the call termination and update the forwarding tables in each of the packet routers on the path to indicate that the VC no longer exists.

In a VC network layer, routers along the path between the two end systems are involved in VC setup, and each router is fully aware of all the VCs passing through it.  
The messages that the end systems send into the network are known as __signaling messages__, and the protocols used to exchange these messages are often referred to as __signaling protocols__.

## Datagram Networks
In a datagram network, each time an end system wants to send a packet, it stamps the packet with the address of the destination end system and then pops the packet into the network.  

As a packet is transmitted from source to destination, it passes through a series of routers. Each of these routers uses the packet's destination address to forward the packet.  Specifically, each router has a forwarding table that maps destination addresses to link interfaces; when a packet arrives at the router, the router uses the packet's destination address to look up the appropriate output link interface in the forwarding table. The router then intentionally forwards the packet to that output link interface.  

To get some further insight into the lookup operation, let's look at a specific example. Suppose that all destination addresses are 32 bits (which just happens to be the length of the destination address in an IP datagram). A brute-force implementation of the forwarding table would have one entry for every possible destination address. Since there are more than 4 billion possible addresses, this option is totally out of the question.  
Now let's further suppose that our router has four links, numbered 0 through 3, and that packets are to be forwarded to the link interfaces as follows:  

![4_5_1](https://github.com/opwid/Library/blob/master/Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach/Images/4_5_1.png)  

Clearly, for this example, it is not necessary to have 4 billion entries in the router's forwarding table. We could, for example, have the following forwarding table with just four entries:  

![4_5_2](https://github.com/opwid/Library/blob/master/Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach/Images/4_5_2.png)  

With this style of forwarding table, the router matches a prefix of the packet's destination address with the entries in the table; if there's a match, the router forwards the packet to a link associated with the match. When there are multiple matches, the router uses the longest prefix matching rule; that is, it finds the longest matching entry in the table and forwards the packet to the link interface associated with the longest prefix match.  

The time scale at which this forwarding state information changes is relatively slow. Indeed, in a datagram network the forwarding tables are modified by the routing algorithms, which typically update a forwarding table every one-to-five minutes or so. Because forwarding tables in datagram networks can be modified at any time, a series of packets sent from one end system to another may follow different paths through the network and may arrive out of order.

# What's Inside a Router?
Four router components can be identified:

* _Input ports_: An input port performs several key functions. It performs the physical layer function of terminating an incoming physical link at a router; this is shown in the leftmost box of the input port and the rightmost box of the output port. An input port also performs link-layer functions needed to interoperate with the link layer at the other side of the incoming link; this is represented by the middle boxes in the input and output ports. Perhaps most crucially, the lookup function is also performed at the input port; this will occur in the rightmost box of the input port. It is here that the forwarding table is consulted to determine the router output port to which an arriving packet will be forwarded via the switching fabric. Control packets (for example, packets carrying routing protocol information) are forwarded from an input port to the routing processor.
* _Switching fabric_: The switching fabric connects the router's input ports to its output ports. This switching fabric is completely contained within the router -a network inside of a network router!
* _Output ports_: An output port stores packets received from the switching fabric and transmits these packets on the outgoing link by performing the necessary link-layer and physical-layer functions. When a link is bidirectional, an output port will typically be paired with the input port for that link on the same line card (a printed circuit board containing one or more input ports, which is connected to the switching fabric).
* _Routing processor_: The routing processor executes the routing protocols, maintains routing tables and attached link state information, and computes the forwarding table for the router. It also performs the network management functions that we'll study in Chapter 9.

A router's input ports, output ports, and switching fabric together implement the forwarding function and are almost always implemented in hardware. These forwarding functions are sometimes collectively referred to as the __router forwarding plane__.  To appreciate why a hardware implementation is needed, consider that with a 10 Gbps input link and a 64-byte IP datagram, the  input port has only 51.2 ns to process the datagram before another datagram may arrive. If N ports are combined on a line card (as is often done in practice), the datagram-processing pipeline must operate N times faster -far too fast for software implementation. Forwarding plane hardware can be implemented either using a router vendor's own hardware designs, or constructed using purchased merchant-silicon chips.  
While the forwarding plane operates at the nanosecond time scale, a router's control functions -executing the routing protocols, responding to attached links that go up or down, and performing management functions- operate at the millisecond or second timescale. These __router control plane__ functions are usually implemented in software and execute on the routing processor (typically a traditional CPU).

## Input Processing
As discussed above, the input port's line termination function and link-layer processing implement the physical and link layers for that individual input link. The lookup performed in the input port is central to the router's operation -it is here that the router uses the forwarding table to look up the output port to which an arriving packet will be forwarded via the switching fabric. The forwarding table is computed and updated by the routing processor, with a shadow copy typically stored at each input port.  
Although "lookup" is arguably the most important action in input port processing, many other actions must be taken: (1) physical- and link-layer processing must occur, as discussed above; (2) the packet's version number, checksum and time-to-live field -all of which we'll study in Section 4.4.1- must be checked and the latter two fields rewritten; and (3) counters used for network management (such as the number of IP datagrams received) must be updated.

## Switching

The switching fabric is at the very heart of a router, as it is through this fabric that the packets are actually switched (that is, forwarded) from an input port to an output port. Switching can be accomplished in a number of ways: 

* _Switching via memory_: The simplest, earliest routers were traditional computers, with switching between input and output ports being done under direct control of the CPU (routing processor). Input and output ports functioned as traditional I/O devices in a traditional operating system. An input port with an arriving packet first signaled the routing processor via an interrupt. The packet was then copied from the input port into processor memory. The routing processor then extracted the destination address from the header, looked up the appropriate output port in the forwarding table, and copied the packet to the output port's buffers. In this scenario, if the memory bandwidth is such that B packets per second can be written into, or read from, memory, then the overall forwarding throughput (the total rate at which packets are transferred from input ports to output ports) must be less than B/2. Note also that two packets cannot be forwarded at the same time, even if they have different destination ports, since only one memory read/write over the shared system bus can be done at a time.
Many modern routers switch via memory. A major difference from early routers, however, is that the lookup of the destination address and the storing of the packet into the appropriate memory location are performed by processing on the input line cards. 

* _Switching via a bus_: In this approach, an input port transfers a packet directly to the output port over a shared bus, without intervention by the routing processor. This is typically done by having the input port pre-pend a switch-internal label (header) to the packet indicating the local output port to which this packet is being transferred and transmitting the packet onto the bus. The packet is received by all output ports, but only the port that matches the label will keep the packet. The  label is then removed at the output port, as this label is only used within the switch to cross the bus. If multiple packets arrive to the router at the same time, each at a different input port, all but one must wait since only one packet can cross the bus at a time. Because every packet must cross the single bus, the switching speed of the router is limited to the bus speed. Nonetheless, switching via a bus is often sufficient for routers that operate in small local area and enterprise networks. 
* _Switching via an interconnection network_: One way to overcome the bandwidth limitation of a single, shared bus is to use a more sophisticated interconnection network. A crossbar switch is an interconnection network consisting of 2N buses that connect N input ports to N output ports.Each vertical bus intersects each horizontal bus at a crosspoint, which can be opened or closed at any time by the switch fabric controller (whose logic is part of the switching fabric itself). Thus, unlike the previous two switching approaches, crossbar networks are capable of forwarding multiple packets in parallel. However, if two packets from two different input ports are destined to the same output port, then one will have to wait at the input, since only one packet can be sent over any given bus at a time.

## Output Processing

Output port processing takes packets that have been stored in the output port's memory and transmits them over the output link. This includes selecting and de-queueing packets for transmission, and performing the needed link-layer and physical-layer transmission functions.

## Where Does Queueing Occur?

Packet queues may form at both the input ports and the output ports. The location and extent of queueing (either at the input port queues or the output port queues) will depend on the traffic load, the relative speed of the switching fabric, and the line speed. Let's now consider these queues in a bit more detail, since as these queues grow large, the router's memory can eventually be exhausted and __packet loss__ will occur when no memory is available to store arriving packets. Recall that in our  earlier discussions, we said that packets were "lost within the network" or "dropped at a router." It is here, at these queues within a router, where such packets are actually dropped and lost.  

Suppose that the input and output line speeds (transmission rates) all have an identical transmission rate of R<sub>line</sub> packets per second, and that there are N input ports and N output ports. To further simplify the discussion, let's assume that all packets have the same fixed length, and the packets arrive to input ports in a synchronous manner. That is, the time to send a packet on any link is equal to the time to receive a packet on any link, and during such an interval of time, either zero or one packet can arrive on an input link. Define the switching fabric transfer rate R<sub>switch</sub> as the rate at which packets can be moved from input port to output port. If R<sub>switch</sub> is N times faster than R<sub>line</sub>, then only negligible queuing will occur at the input ports. This is because even in the worst case, where all N input lines are receiving packets, and all packets are to be forwarded to the same output port, each batch of N packets (one packet per input port) can be cleared through the switch fabric before the next batch arrives.  

But what can happen at the output ports? Let's suppose that R<sub>switch</sub> is still N times faster than R<sub>line</sub>. Once again, packets arriving at each of the N input ports are destined to the same output port. In this case, in the time it takes to send a single packet onto the outgoing link, N new packets will arrive at this output port. Since the output port can transmit only a single packet in a unit of time (the packet transmission time), the N arriving packets will have to queue (wait) for transmission over the outgoing link. Then N more packets can possibly arrive in the time it takes to transmit just one of the N packets that had just previously been queued. And so on. Eventually, the number of queued packets can grow large enough to exhaust available memory at the output port, in which case packets are dropped.  

Given that router buffers are needed to absorb the fluctuations in traffic load, the natural question to ask is how much buffering is required. For many years, the rule of thumb [RFC 3439] for buffer sizing was that the amount of buffering (B) should be equal to an average round-trip time (RTT, say 250 msec) times the link capacity (C). This result is based on an analysis of the queueing dynamics of a relatively small number of TCP flows. Recent theoretical and experimental efforts [Appenzeller 2004], however, suggest that when there are a large number of TCP flows (N) passing through a link, the amount of buffering needed is B = (RTT\*C)/√N . With a large number of flows typically passing through large backbone router links the value of N can be large, with the decrease in needed buffer size becoming quite significant.  

A consequence of output port queuing is that a __packet scheduler__ at the output port must choose one packet among those queued for transmission. This selection might be done on a simple basis, such as first-come-first-served (FCFS) scheduling, or a more sophisticated scheduling discipline such as weighted fair queuing (WFQ), which shares the outgoing link fairly among the different end-to-end connections that have packets queued for transmission. Packet scheduling plays a crucial role in providing __quality-of-service guarantees__.  

Similarly, if there is not enough memory to buffer an incoming packet, a decision must be made to either drop the arriving packet (a policy known as drop-tail) or remove one or more already-queued packets to make room for the newly arrived packet. In some cases, it may be advantageous to drop (or mark the header of) a packet before the buffer is full in order to provide a congestion signal to the sender. A number of packet-dropping and -marking policies (which collectively have become known as __active queue management__ (__AQM__) algorithms) have been proposed and analyzed [Labrador 1999, Hollot 2002]. One of the most widely studied and implemented AQM algorithms is the __Random Early Detection__ (__RED__) algorithm.  

If the switch fabric is not fast enough (relative to the input line speeds) to transfer all arriving packets through the fabric without delay, then packet queuing can also occur at the input ports, as packets must join input port queues to wait their turn to be transferred through the switching fabric to the output port.  

Figure 4.11 shows an example in which two packets (darkly shaded) at the front of their input queues are destined for the same upper-right output port. Suppose that the switch fabric chooses to transfer the packet from the front of the upper-left queue. In this case, the darkly shaded packet in the lower-left queue must wait. But not only must this darkly shaded packet wait, so too must the lightly shaded packet that is queued behind that packet in the lower-left queue, even though there is no contention for the middle-right output port (the destination for the lightly shaded packet). This phenomenon is known as __head-of-the-line__ (__HOL__) blocking in an input-queued  switch -a queued packet in an input queue must wait for transfer through the fabric (even though its output port is free) because it is blocked by another packet at the head of the line.

## The Routing Control Plane

We've implicitly assumed that the routing control plane fully resides and executes in a routing processor within the router. The network-wide routing control plane is thus decentralized -with different pieces (e.g., of a routing algorithm) executing at different routers and interacting by sending control messages to each other. Indeed, today's Internet routers and the routing algorithms we'll study in Section 4.6 operate in exactly this manner. Additionally, router and switch vendors bundle their hardware data plane and software control plane together into closed (but inter-operable) platforms in a vertically integrated product.

# The Internet Protocol (IP): Forwarding and Addressing in the Internet
In this section, we'll turn our attention to how addressing and forwarding are done in the Internet. The Internet's network layer has three major components. The first component is the IP protocol, the topic of this section. The second major component is the routing component, which determines the path a datagram follows from source to destination. We mentioned earlier that routing protocols compute the forwarding tables that are used to forward packets through the network. The final component of the network layer, the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), is a facility to report errors in datagrams and respond to requests for certain network-layer information. 

## Datagram Format 
Recall that a network-layer packet is referred to as a datagram. We begin our study of IP with an overview of the syntax and semantics of the IPv4 datagram. IPv4 datagram format is shown in Figure 4.13. The key fields in the IPv4 datagram are the following:
