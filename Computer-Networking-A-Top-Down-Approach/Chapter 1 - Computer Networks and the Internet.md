__Host__ or __end systems__: Many nontraditional devices such as laptops, smart phones, web cams that are being hooked up to the Internet. End systems are connected together by a network of __communication links__ and __packet switches__. Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the __transmission rate__ of a link measured in bits/second. When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system segments data and adds header bytes to each segment. The resulting packages of information, known as __packets__, are then sent through the network to the destination end system, where they are reassembled into the original data.

A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. The two most prominent packet switch types are __routers__ and __link-layer switches__. Both types of switches forward packets toward their ultimate destinations. Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks, while routes are typically used in network core. The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as a __route__ or __path__ through the network. 

End systems access the Internet through __Internet Service Providers__. Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links. ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to the end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem, or DSL, high-speed local area network access, wireless access and dial-up modem access. The Internet is about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must be also connected. These lower-tier ISPs are interconnected through national and international upper-tier ISPs such as AT&T and Sprint.

End systems, packet switches, and other pieces of the Internet run __protocols__ that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet. The __Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)__ and the __Internet Protocol__ are two of the most important protocols in the Internet.

A __protocol__ defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communication entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.

__Access Networks__: The network that physically connects an end system to the first router(also known as edge router) on a path from the end system to any other distant end system. 

## Home Access: DSL, Cable FTTH, Dial-Up and Satellite
Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are __digital subscriber line (DSL)__ and __cable__. A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephony company (telco) that provides its local phone access. Each customer's DSL modem uses the existing telephone line to exchange data with digital subscriber line access multiplexer(DSLAM) located in the telco's local central office. The home's DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over phone wires to central office, the analog signals from many such houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM.

While DSL makes use of the telco's existing local telephone infrastructure, __cable Internet__ access makes use of the cable television company's existing cable television infrastructure. Fiber optics connect the cable head end to neighborhood-level junctions, from which traditional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual houses and apartments. Cable Internet access requires special modems, called cable modems, As with a DSL modem, the cable modem is typically an external device and connects to the home PC through an Ethernet port. At the cable head end, the cable modem termination system (CMTS) serves a similar function as the DSL network's DSLAM.

Although DSL and cable networks currently represent more than 90 percent of residential broadband access in the US, an up-and-coming technology that promises even higher speeds is the deployment of __fiber to the home (FTTH)__. As the name suggest, the concept is simple - provide an optical fiber path from the central office directly to the home. There are several competing technologies for optical distribution from central office to homes. The simplest optical distribution network is called direct fiber, with one fiber leaving central office for each home. More commonly, each fiber leaving central office is actually shared by many homes; it is not until the fiber gets relatively close to the homes that it is split into individual customer specific fibers. There are two competing optical-distribution network architectures that perform this splitting: active optical networks and passive optical networks. 

## Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and Wifi

On corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home settings, a local area network (LAN) is used to connect an end system to the edge router. Ethernet is by far the most prevalent LAN technology in corporate, university and home networks. Wireless LAN access based on IEEE 802.11 technology is called WiFi.

## Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE

Telecommunication companies have made enormous investments is so-called third-generation(3G) wireless, which provides packet-switched wide-are wireless Internet access at the speed in excess of 1 Mbps. LTE has its roots in 3G technology, and can potentially achieve rates in excess of 10 Mbps.

# The Network Core
## Packet Switching
To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as packets. Between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links and __packet switches__(there are two prominent types: routers and link-layer switches). Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal to the full transmission rate of the link. So, if a source end systems or a packet switch is sending a packet of L bits over a link with transmission rate R bits/sec, then the time to transmit the packet is L/R seconds.  
__Store-and-Forward Transmission__: It means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. Most packet switches uses store-and-forward transmission at the inputs to the links.  
Now consider the general case of sending one packet from source to destination over a path consisting of N links each of rate R(thus, there are N-1 routers between source and destination). We see that the end-to-end delay is : d<sub>end-to-end</sub> = N * (L/R)  
__Queuing Delays and Packet Loss__: Each packet switch has multiple attached link, the packet switch has an __output buffer__, which stores packets that the router is about to send into that link. If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet must wait in the output buffer. Thus, in addition to the store-and forward delays, packets suffer output buffer queuing delays. Since the amount of buffer space is finite, an arriving packet may find that the buffer is completely full with other packets waiting for transmission. In this case, __packet loss__ will occur, either the arriving packet or one of the already-queued packets will be dropped.  
__Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols__: How does the router determine which link it should forward the packet onto? In the Internet, every end system has an address called an IP address. When a source end system wants to send a packet to a destination end system, the source includes the destination's IP address in the packet's header. When a packet arrives at a router in the network, the router examines a portion of the packet's destination address and forwards the packet to an adjacent router. More specifically, each router has a __forwarding table__ that maps destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that router's outbound links. When a packet arrives at a router, the router examines the address and searches its forwarding table, using this destination address, to find the appropriate outbound link. The router then directs the packet to this outbound link. Internet has a number of special __routing protocols__ that are used to automatically set the forwarding tables. A routing protocol may determine the shortest path from each router to each destination and use the shortest path results to configure path from the forwarding tables in the routers. (More in Chapter 4)

## Circuit Switching
In circuit switched networks, the resources needed along a path(buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are _reserved_ for the duration of the communication session between end systems. In packet switched networks, these resources are _not_ reserved; a session's messages use the resources on demand, and as a consequence, may have to wait for access to a communication link. Traditional telephone networks are examples of circuit switched networks. When the network establishes the circuit, it also reserves a constant transmission rate in the network's links for the duration of the connection.  

## A Network of Networks
In summary, today’s Internet—a network of networks—is complex, consisting of a dozen or so tier-1 ISPs and hundreds of thousands of lower-tier ISPs. The ISPs are diverse in their coverage, with some spanning multiple continents and oceans, and others limited to narrow geographic regions. The lower-tier ISPs connect to the higher-tier ISPs, and the higher-tier ISPs interconnect with one another. Users and content providers are customers of lower-tier ISPs, and lower-tier ISPs are customers of higher-tier ISPs. In recent years, major content providers have also created their own networks and connect directly into lower-tier ISPs where possible.

# Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks
As a packet travels from one host to the subsequent host along a path, the packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along the path. The most important of these delays are the __nodal processing delay__, __queuing delay__, __transmission delay__, and __propagation delay__; together these delays accumulate to give a __total nodal delay__.  

__Processing Delay__: The time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet is part of the __processing delay__. The processing delay can also include the time needed to check for bit-level errors in the packet that occurred in transmitting the packet's bits from the upstream node to router A.  

__Queuing Delay__: At the queue, the packet experiences a __queuing delay__ as it waits to be transmitted onto the link. The length of the queuing delay of a specific packet will depend on the number of earlier-arriving packets that are queued and waiting for transmission onto the link. If the queue is empty and no other packet is currently being transmitted, then our packet's queuing delay will be zero. Unlike three other delays, the queuing delay can vary from packet to packet.  

__Transmission Delay__: Denote the length of the packet by _L_ bits, and denote the transmission rate of the link from router A to router B by _R_ bits/sec. The __transmission delay__ is _L/R_. This is the amount of time required to transmit all of the packet's bits into the link. The transmission delay is the amount of time required for the router to push out the packet; it is a function of the packet’s length and the transmission rate of the link, but has nothing to do with the distance between the two
routers.  

__Propagation Delay__: Once a bit is pushed into the link, it needs to propagate to router B. The time required to propagate from the beginning of the link to router B is the __propagation delay__. The bit propagates at the propagation speed of the link. The propagation speed depends on the physical medium of the link. The propagation delay is the distance between two routers divided by the propagation speed. That is, the propagation delay is _d/s_, where _d_ is the distance between router A and router B and _s_ is the propagation speed of the link. It is a function of the distance between the two routers, but has nothing to do with the packet's lenght or the transmission rate of the link. 

![NODAL_DELAY](https://github.com/opwid/Library/blob/master/Computer-Networking-A-Top-Down-Approach/Images/nodal_delay.png) 

Let _a_ denote the average rate at which packets arrive at the queue (_a_ is in units of packets/sec). The ratio _La/R_, called the __traffic intensity__, often plays an important role in estimating the extent of the queuing delay. If a packet arrive to a full queue, the router will drop that packet; that is, the packet will be lost. The fraction of lost packets increases as the traffic intensity increases. Therefore, performance at a node is often measured not only in terms of delay, but also in terms of the probability of packet loss. If La/R > 1, then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue exceeds the rate at which the bits can be transmitted from the queue. In this unfortunate situation, the queue will tend to increase without bound and the queuing delay will approach infinity. Now consider La/R <= 1. Here , the nature of the arriving traffic impacts the queuing delay. For example, if the packets arrive periodically, that is, one packet arrives at L/R seconds, then every packet will arrive at the empty queue and there will be no queuing delay. On the other hand, if packets arrive in burst but periodically, there can be a significant average queuing delay. For example, suppose N packets arrive simultaneously every (L/R)N seconds. Then the first packet transmitted has no queuing delay; the second packet transmitted has a queuing delay of L/R seconds; and more generally, the nth packet transmitted has a queuing delay of (n-1)L/R seconds.   

__End-to-End Delay__: Now consider the total delay from source to destination. To get a handle on this concept, suppose there are N-1 routers between the source host and the destination host. d<sub>end-end</sub> = N(d<sub>proc</sub> + d<sub>trans</sub> + d<sub>prop</sub>)

__Traceroute__: Traceroute is a simple program that can run in any Internet host. When the user specifies a destination hostname, the program in the source host send multiple, special packets toward destination. As these packets work their way toward the destination, they pass through a series of routers. When a router receives one of these special packets, it sends back to the source a short message that contains the name and address of the router.  

__Throughput in Computer Networks__: To define throughput, consider transferring a large file from Host A to Host B across a computer network. The __instantaneous throughput__ at any instant of time is the rate (in bits/sec) at which Host B is receiving the file. Many applications, including many P2P file sharing systems, display the instantaneous throughput during downloads in the user interface. If the file contains of F bits and the transfer takes T seconds for Host B to receive all F bits, then the __average throughput__ of the file transfer is F/T bps. For simple two-link network, the throughput is min{R<sub>client</sub>,R<sub>server</sub>}, that is the transmission rate of the __bootleneck link__. Having determined the throughput, we can now approximate the time it takes to transfer a large file of F bits from server to client as F/min{R<sub>client</sub>,R<sub>server</sub>}.
