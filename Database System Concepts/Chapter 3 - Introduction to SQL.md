# SQL Data Definition

The set of relations in a database must be specified to the system by means of a data-definition language (DDL).
## Basic Types
* char(n): A fixed-length character string with user-specified length n. The full form, character, can be used instead.
* varchar(n): A variable-length character string with user-specified maximum length n. The full form, character varying, is equivalent.
* int: An integer (a finite subset of the integers that is machine dependent). The full form, integer, is equivalent.
* smallint: A small integer (a machine-dependent subset of the integer type).
* numeric( p, d): A fixed-point number with user-specified precision. The number consists of p digits (plus a sign), and d of the p digits are to the right of the decimal point. Thus, numeric(3,1) allows 44.5 to be stored exactly, but neither 444.5 or 0.32 can be stored exactly in a field of this type.
* real, double precision: Floating-point and double-precision floating-point numbers with machine-dependent precision.
* float(n): A floating-point number, with precision of at least n digits.

Each type may include a special value called the null value.

## Basic Schema Definition
We define an SQL relation by using the __create table__ command.
```SQL
create table department
(dept_name varchar (20),
building varchar (15),
budget numeric (12,2),
primary key (dept_name));
```
SQL supports a number of different integrity constraints. SQL prevents any update to the database that violates an integrity constraint. In this section, we discuss only a few of them:
* __primary key (A1, A2, ..., An)__: The primary-key specification says that attributes A1, A2, ..., An form the primary key for the relation. The primary-key attributes are required to be nonnull and unique; that is, no tuple can have a null value for a primary-key attribute, and no two tuples in the relation can be equal on all the primary-key attributes. Although the primary-key specification is optional, it is generally a good idea to specify a primary key for each relation.
* __foreign key (A1, A2, ..., An) references s__: The foreign key specification says that the values of attributes (A1, A2, ..., An) for any tuple in the relation must correspond to values of the primary key attributes of some tuple in relation s.
* __not null__: The not null constraint on an attribute specifies that the null value is not allowed for that attribute; in other words, the constraint excludes the null value from the domain of that attribute.

A newly created relation is empty initially. We can use the __insert__ command to load data into the relation.
```SQL
insert into instructor
values (10211, 'Smith', 'Biology', 66000);
```
We can use the _delete_ command to delete tuples from a relation.
```SQL
delete from student;
```
To remove a relation from an SQL database, we use the __drop table__ command. The drop table command deletes all information about the dropped relation from the database.

```SQL
drop table r;
```

We use the __alter table__ command to add attributes to an existing relation. All tuples in the relation are assigned null as the value for the new attribute. The form of the alter table command is
```SQL
alter table r add A D;
```
where r is the name of an existing relation, A is the name of the attribute to be added, and D is the type of the added attribute. We can drop attributes from a relation by the command
```SQL
alter table r drop A;
```
where r is the name of an existing relation, and A is the name of an attribute of the relation.

# Basic Structure of SQL Queries

## Queries on a Single Relation
Consider another query, "Find the department names of all instructors," which can be written as:
```SQL
select dept_name from instructor;
```
Since more than one instructor can belong to a department, a department name could appear more than once in the instructor relation. In practice, duplicate elimination is time-consuming. Therefore, SQL allows duplicates in relations as well as in the results of SQL expressions. Thus, the preceding SQL query lists each department name once for every tuple in which it appears in the instructor relation. In those cases where we want to force the elimination of duplicates, we insert the keyword __distinct__ after select. We can rewrite the preceding query as:
```SQL
select distinct dept_name from instructor;
```

SQL allows us to use the keyword __all__ to specify explicitly that duplicates are not removed. Since duplicate retention is the default, we shall not use all in our examples.  

The __select__ clause may also contain arithmetic expressions involving the operators +, âˆ’, *, and / operating on constants or attributes of tuples. For example, the query: 
```SQL
select ID , name, dept name, salary * 1.1
from instructor;
```
returns a relation that is the same as the instructor relation, except that the attribute salary is multiplied by 1.1.  

The __where__ clause allows us to select only those rows in the result relation of the from clause that satisfy a specified predicate. Consider the query "Find the names of all instructors in the Computer Science department who have salary greater than $70,000." This query can be written in SQL as:
```SQL
select name
from instructor
where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.' and salary > 70000;
```
SQL allows the use of the logical connectives and, or, and not in the where clause. The operands of the logical connectives can be expressions involving the comparison operators <, <=, >, >=, =, and <>. SQL allows us to use the comparison operators to compare strings and arithmetic expressions, as well as special types, such as date types.

## Queries on Multiple Relations

An an example, suppose we want to answer the query "Retrieve the names of all instructors, along with their department names and department building name."  

Looking at the schema of the relation instructor, we realize that we can get the department name from the attribute dept_name, but the department building name is present in the attribute building of the relation department. To answer the query, each tuple in the instructor relation must be matched with the tuple in the department relation whose dept_name value matches the dept_name value of the instructor tuple.  

In SQL, to answer the above query, we list the relations that need to be accessed in the from clause, and specify the matching condition in the where clause. The above query can be written in SQL as
```SQL
select name, instructor.dept_name, building
from instructor, department
where instructor.dept_name= department.dept_name;
```
Note that the attribute dept_name occurs in both the relations instructor and department, and the relation name is used as a prefix (in instructor.dept_name, and department.dept_name) to make clear to which attribute we are referring. In contrast, the attributes name and building appear in only one of the relations, and therefore do not need to be prefixed by the relation name.  

The role of each clause is as follows:
* The select clause is used to list the attributes desired in the result of a query.
* The from clause is a list of the relations to be accessed in the evaluation of the query. The from clause by itself defines a __Cartesian product__ of the relations listed in the clause.
* The where clause is a predicate involving attributes of the relation in the from clause.

The predicate in the where clause is used to restrict the combinations created by the Cartesian product to those that are meaningful for the desired answer. We would expect a query involving instructor and teaches to combine a particular tuple t in instructor with only those tuples in teaches that refer to the same instructor to which t refers. That is, we wish only to match teaches tuples with instructor tuples that have the same ID value. The following SQL query ensures this condition, and outputs the instructor name and course identifiers from such matching tuples.
```SQL
select name, course_id
from instructor, teaches
where instructor.ID = teaches.ID;
```

## The Natural Join 

In our example query that combined information from the instructor and teaches table, the matching condition required instructor.ID to be equal to teaches.ID. These are the only attributes in the two relations that have the same name. In fact this is a common case; that is, the matching condition in the from clause most often requires all attributes with matching names to be equated. To make the life of an SQL programmer easier for this common case, SQL supports an operation called the __natural join__, which we describe below. In fact SQL supports several other ways in which information from two or more relations can be joined together. We have already seen how a Cartesian product along with a where clause predicate can be used to join information from multiple relations.  

The natural join operation operates on two relations and produces a relation as the result. Unlike the Cartesian product of two relations, which concatenates each tuple of the first relation with every tuple of the second, natural join considers only those pairs of tuples with the same value on those attributes that appear in the schemas of both relations. So, going back to the example of the relations instructor and teaches, computing instructor natural join teaches considers only those pairs of tuples where both the tuple from instructor and the tuple from teaches have the same value on the common attribute, ID.  

Consider the query "For all instructors in the university who have taught some course, find their names and the course ID of all courses they taught", which we wrote earlier as:
```SQL
select name, course_id
from instructor, teaches
where instructor.ID = teaches.ID ;
```
This query can be written more concisely using the natural-join operation in SQL as:
```SQL
select name, course_id
from instructor natural join teaches;
```
Both of the above queries generate the same result.  

A from clause in an SQL query can have multiple relations combined using natural join, as shown here:  

select A<sub>1</sub> , A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>n</sub>  
from r<sub>1</sub> natural join r<sub>2</sub> natural join ... natural join r<sub>m</sub>  
where P;  

For example, suppose we wish to answer the query "List the names of instructors along with the the titles of courses that they teach." The query can be written in SQL as follows:
```SQL
select name, title
from instructor natural join teaches, course
where teaches.course_id = course.course_id;
```
The natural join of instructor and teaches is first computed, as we saw earlier, and a Cartesian product of this result with course is computed, from which the where clause extracts only those tuples where the course identifier from the join result matches the course identifier from the course relation. Note that teaches.course_id in the where clause refers to the course_id field of the natural join result, since this field in turn came from the teaches relation.  

To provide the benefit of natural join while avoiding the danger of equating attributes erroneously, SQL provides a form of the natural join construct that allows you to specify exactly which columns should be equated. This feature is illustrated by the following query:
```SQL
select name, title
from (instructor natural join teaches) join course using (course_id);
```
The operation __join ... using__ requires a list of attribute names to be specified. Both inputs must have attributes with the specified names. Consider the operation r<sub>1</sub> join r<sub>2</sub> using(A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>). The operation is similar to r<sub>1</sub> natural join r<sub>2</sub>, except that a pair of tuples t<sub>1</sub> from r<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> from r<sub>2</sub> match if t<sub>1</sub>.A<sub>1</sub> = t<sub>2</sub>.A<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>1</sub>.A<sub>2</sub> = t<sub>2</sub>.A<sub>2</sub>; even if r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub> both have an attribute named A<sub>3</sub>, it is not required that t<sub>1</sub>.A<sub>3</sub> = t<sub>2</sub>.A<sub>3</sub>.

# Additional Basic Operations
## The Rename Operation
Consider again the query that we used earlier:
```SQL
select name, course_id
from instructor, teaches
where instructor.ID = teaches.ID;
```
The names of the attributes in the result are derived from the names of the attributes in the relations in the from clause.  

We cannot, however, always derive names in this way, for several reasons: First, two relations in the from clause may have attributes with the same name, in which case an attribute name is duplicated in the result. Second, if we used an arithmetic expression in the select clause, the resultant attribute does not have a name. Third, even if an attribute name can be derived from the base relations as in the preceding example, we may want to change the attribute name in the result `instructor.name`. Hence, SQL provides a way of renaming the attributes of a result relation. It uses the as clause, taking the form:
```SQL
select name as instructor_name, course_id
from instructor, teaches
where instructor.ID = teaches.ID;
```
```SQL
select T.name, S.course_id
from instructor as T, teaches as S
where T.ID = S.ID;
```
Another reason to rename a relation is a case where we wish to compare tuples in the same relation.
```SQL
select distinct T.name
from instructor as T, instructor as S
where T.salary > S.salary and S.dept name = 'Biology';
```
Observe that we could not use the notation instructor.salary, since it would not be clear which reference to instructor is intended.

## String Operations
SQL specifies strings by enclosing them in single quotes, for example, 'Computer'. A single quote character that is part of a string can be specified by using two single quote characters; for example, the string 'It's right' can be specified by 'It''s right'. Another way is using single quote character inside double quotes; for examle, "It's right".  

SQL also permits a variety of functions on character strings, such as concatenating (using "||"), extracting substrings, finding the length of strings, converting strings to uppercase (using the function upper(s) where s is a string) and lowercase (using the function lower(s)), removing spaces at the end of the string (using trim(s)) and so on.
```SQL
select concat("Departmant name:", DEPT_NAME) from department;
+---------------------------------------+
| concat("Departmant name:", DEPT_NAME) |
+---------------------------------------+
| Departmant name:CE                    |
| Departmant name:EE                    |
| Departmant name:History               |
| Departmant name:Arts                  |
+---------------------------------------+

select concat("Departmant name:", DEPT_NAME) as department_name from department;
+---------------------------------------+
| department_name                       |
+---------------------------------------+
| Departmant name:CE                    |
| Departmant name:EE                    |
| Departmant name:History               |
| Departmant name:Arts                  |
+---------------------------------------+

```
Pattern matching can be performed on strings, using the operator __like__. We describe patterns by using two special characters:

* Percent (%): The % character matches any substring.
* Underscore (_): The character matches any character.

Consider the query "Find the names of all departments whose building name includes the substring 'Watson'." This query can be written as:
```SQL
select dept_name
from department
where building like '%Watson%';
```
