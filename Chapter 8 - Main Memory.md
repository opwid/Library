# Background

## Basic Hardware
Main memory and the registers built into the processor itself are the only general-purpose storage that the CPU can access directly. There are machine instructions that take memory addresses as arguments, but none that take disk addresses. Therefore, any instructions in execution, and any data being used by the instructions, must be in one of these direct-access storage devices. If the data are not in memory, they must be moved there before the CPU can operate on them.  

Registers that are built into the CPU are generally accessible within one cycle of the CPU clock. Most CPU s can decode instructions and perform simple operations on register contents at the rate of one or more operations per clock tick. The same cannot be said of main memory, which is accessed via a transaction on the memory bus. Completing a memory access may take many cycles of the CPU clock. This situation is intolerable because of the frequency of memory accesses. The remedy is to add fast memory, called cache, between the CPU and main memory, typically on the CPU chip for fast access.  

For proper system operation we must protect the operating system from access by user processes. On multiuser systems, we must additionally protect user processes from one another. This protection must be provided by the hardware because the operating system doesn't usually intervene between the CPU and its memory accesses. Hardware implements this production in several different ways, as we show throughout the chapter. Here, we outline one possible implementation.  

We first need to make sure that each process has a separate memory space. Separate per-process memory space protects the processes from each other and is fundamental to having multiple processes loaded in memory for concurrent execution. To separate memory spaces, we need the ability to determine the range of legal addresses that the process may access and to ensure that the process can access only these legal addresses. We can provide this protection by using two registers, usually a base and a limit. The __base register__ holds the smallest legal physical memory address; the __limit register__ specifies the size of the range. For example, if the base register holds 300040 and the limit register is 120900, then the program can legally access all addresses from 300040 through 420939.
