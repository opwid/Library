The virtual address space of the processor is general divided into two parts by the Linux kernel. Lower part is for user processes, and upper part is reserved for kernel. 
* UMA (uniform memory access) machines organize available memory in a contigiuous fashion. Each processor (in a symmetric  multiprocessor system) is able to access each memory area equally quickly.
