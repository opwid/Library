# General Trees

we define a tree T as a set of nodes storing elements such that the nodes have a parent-child relationship that satisfies the following properties:  
* If T is nonempty, it has a special node, called the root of T , that has no parent.
* Each node v of T different from the root has a unique parent node w; every node with parent w is a child of w.
